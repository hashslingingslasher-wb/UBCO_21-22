The Bloody Sire>>
Stark violence is still the sire of all the world’s values.
Violence has been the sire of all the world’s values.
Who formed Christ but Herod and Caesar,
The cruel and bloody victories of Caesar?
Violence, the bloody sire of all the world’s values.
Old violence is not too old to beget new values.
>>Irritation w/ violence--possibly in response to WWII
last line hints at progression towards "new values" that have not been
sired by violence.

For Una>>
-never
We have watched mankind like Christ
Toil up and up,
To be hanged at the top.

It is not Europe alone that is falling
Into blood and fire.
Decline and fall have been dancing in all men’s souls
For a long while.
>>reference to fall of man? (genesis)

ANTIPODES: a direct opposite

Volta>> To-night, dear,
Let’s forget all that, that and the war,

>>Reflection on fall of man and continuing fall, resolved by shifting perspective 
to here & now
fatal acceptance

Cassandra
Therefore the poets honey their truth with lying; but religion—
Vendors and political men
Pour from the barrel, new lies on the old, and are praised for kind
Wisdom. Poor bitch be wise.
>>criticism of organised religion, perhaps catholicism specifically

Cassandra--metaphor for poetry?
ignored prophet--truth hurts --prophet's dilemma {futile voice}

Vulture
What a sublime end of one's body, what an enskyment; what a life
after death.

Original Sin
These are the people.
This is the human dawn. As for me, I would rather

Be a worm in a wild apple than a son of man.
But we are what we are, and we might remember
Not to hate any person, for all are vicious;
And not be astonished at any evil, all are deserved;
And not fear death; it is the only way to be cleansed. 
>>Darwinian account for the original sin
>>reincarnation ref. "death is the only way to be cleansed" + "I would rather 
be a worm in a wild apple than a son of man
>>suicide "death is the onyl way to be cleansed"

>>beauty exists in the world not in humans
transhuman--inhumanism

The Deer Lay Down Their Bones
>>human atrocities realized in death of animals (innocents)

But that's a foolish thing to confess, and a little cowardly. We
know that life
Is on the whole quite equally good and bad, mostly gray neutral, and can
be endured
To the dim end, no matter what magic of grass, water and precipice, and
pain of wounds,
Makes death look dear.

>>Significance of life, motivation to live fully in wake of somber events
& poor choices
>>deep shame
